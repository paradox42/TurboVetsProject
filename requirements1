Overview:
You’ll build a secure task management system using a modular NX monorepo, with
both frontend and backend components. The goal is to demonstrate your ability to
design and implement a system where users with different roles can securely manage
tasks within an organization

Focus Areas (what we care about most):
●
How you designed and implemented RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
●
How your guards/decorators enforce security at the service/API layer
●
Any trade-offs or design decisions in your RBAC implementation
●
Challenges you faced and how you solved them
●
What you’d improve with more time

Secure, scalable RBAC implementation
●
Code clarity and maintainability
●
Functional and responsive UI
●
Effective state management (NgRx)
●
Quality of documentation and tests
●
Bonus: UI polish (drag-and-drop, dark mode, etc.)
